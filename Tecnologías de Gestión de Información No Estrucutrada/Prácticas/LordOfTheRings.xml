      <post autor="ebneter" fecha="2016-08-03T03:38:40" texto="Folks,

The current political season in the United States is one of the most tumultuous and contentious in many years, and many people have passionate views about one candidate or another.

Please **KEEP IT OUT OF /r/lotr**. Political posts and comments *will be deleted*, regardless of motivation. (*Especially* that Gollum meme.) There are dozens if not hundreds of other forums for you to express your political opinions on. The moderators have discussed this matter and are 100% in agreement on this. Repeat offenders may be banned without warning.

/r/lotr is for the discussion of J.R.R. Tolkien's works and works derived from and related to them. Let's keep it that way, and keep it a haven of civility* in these next few months.


\* Well, as much as it ever is..." titulo="MOD POST: /r/lotr is 100% Politics-Free">

      <post autor="pytruong" fecha="2016-11-28T02:48:53" texto="The girlfriend and I thought of creating cards for her sister for Christmas because there was no Lord of the Rings expansion for Munchkin (board game: http://www.worldofmunchkin.com/game/ ) AND because we love to play Munchkin! Without further ado... here's the idea:

We will have player cards (similar to Adventure Time) that is based off of the 9 characters from Fellowship of the Ring.

Landmarks will either become a one-shot for the player or one-shots to power up the monsters.

And of course you got your gear (weapon, armors, etc).

Well, take a look at this: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oXX1OION5wPeIJ81Ql5shcQWY3ZIytGrRvCjjr9Uve0/edit?usp=sharing

Just trying to ask the community if anyone can help us with new ideas or editing the current ideas that we have in place. We would like to implement the whole trilogy of LOTR. Thank you!

         <comentario autor="iBear83" fecha="2016-11-26T12:01:11" texto="&gt;I've read that Gandalf cannot directly interfere with the quest to destroy the ring and can't use his full power.

Close, but not quite.  Gandalf *does* directly interfere with the quest to destroy the Ring.  Remember how he was literally the leader of the Fellowship, guiding them on their path to destroy the Ring?

Rule #1: Gandalf is *forbidden* &quot;to match Sauron's power with power.&quot;  This seems to mean that Gandalf is not allowed (by those who sent him) to make himself the sorcerous overlord of Gondor and raise armies to do his bidding and destroy the realm of Mordor.  The passage could also be interpreted that Gandalf was not allowed to develop his magical abilities until they rivaled those of Sauron...but that was never really an option to begin with.  Gandalf simply didn't have the raw firepower necessary to play Dumbledore vs Voldemort against the Lord of the Ring.

But on top of that, Gandalf (and the other wizards) *are not faking their bodies.*  They are *really* flesh and blood, walking around with skinned knees and arthritis and even dysentery, should they choose to travel the Oregon Trail.  A mortal, corporeal, flesh-and-blood-and-last-night's-chili form simply cannot harness or wield the full power that Gandalf was capable of as Olorin in the West.  

Saruman broke Rule #1.  He decided &quot;screw it, I'm stealing the Ring for myself and taking over the world!&quot;  He was the second most badass mage (Sauron takes the gold medal in that category...but they both flunked out of the running for Miss Congeniality.) Middle Earth had seen since the end of the First Age when the Valar themselves went to war against Morgoth.  But he was still mortal.  Wormtongue cut his throat, and Saruman the Wise, Saruman of Many Colours, Master of Orthanc and self-proclaimed Ringmaker, just died on Frodo's doorstep like a whiny little bastard."/>
         <comentario autor="Belegorn" fecha="2016-11-26T14:32:41" texto="Yes Gandalf can and did use his full powers, see the fight with **Durin's Bane** recounted in **The White Rider**. He and his peers were to act as guides to bring the people of Middle-earth together to deal with Sauron. They were not to lord over, or cow them with their powers. As to the Quest, he led it until they reached the eastern gate of Moria. Sure he can decide when and where to use his full powers, or to what degree. Like when an adult plays with a child compared to an adult; i.e. Gandalf the White with the three companions:

&gt; He lifted up his staff, and Gimli's axe leaped from his grasp and fell ringing on the ground. The sword of Aragorn, stiff in his motionless hand, blazed with a sudden fire. Legolas gave a great shout and shot an arrow high into the air: it vanished in a flash of flame. (The White Rider)

Or Gandalf the Grey with **Durin's Bane**:

&gt; &quot;There was none to see, or perhaps in after ages songs would still be sung of the Battle of the Peak.&quot; Suddenly Gandalf laughed. &quot;But what would they say in song? Those that looked up from afar thought that the mountain was crowned with storm. Thunder they heard, and lightning, they said, smote upon Celebdil, and leapt back broken into tongues of fire. Is that not enough? A great smoke rose about us, vapour and steam. Ice fell like rain.&quot; (The White Rider)"/>
         <comentario autor="Pavrik_Yzerstrom" fecha="2016-11-27T08:42:20" texto="All the wizards are somewhat restricted on their mortal forms, as opposed to Sauron, who is not. That being said, they still (initially) held back a lot of what power they did have because of the rules the Valar set for them. Saruman broke this, Gandalf did not. Gandalf was allowed to use all his power against the Balrog because the Balrog was a demon of times before LOTR, and not related to the events at hand. The description we have of that battle is one of fire and lightning in a storm type god battle of epic proportion, and I think that hints at how powerful Gandalf actually could be had he broken the rules, potentially rivaling Sauron in a similar way that Saruman did. "/>
         <comentario autor="SocraticVoyager" fecha="2016-11-27T10:30:47" texto="Keep in mind the times we actually *do* see Gandalf unleash his power, or at least part of it. The encounter with the spirit-wolves near Moria was entirely one-sided towards Gandalf. No doubt the rest of the Fellowship's warriors could have held their own but Gandalf literally just fire nova-ed the enemy and they turned tail. 

Note how first he stated something along the lines of &quot;Gandalf is here. Turn back before you get hurt.&quot; Every time we see Gandalf pre-engagement he makes the same proclamation. His words to the Balrog at the bridge were such a message, worded in more ancient, mythological vocabulary. 

It seems that Gandalf was allowed to unleash at least part of his power when confronted directly and with no reasonable means to flee. We see that Ol' G is fully capable of holding all *nine* Nazgul by himself as he did at Weathertop, as well as fighting an ancient demon to a draw after his fall in Moria. So, when necessary, Gandalf is fully capable of kicking major ass, he just usually acts as counselor &amp; advisor or as a kind of rallying beacon for the Free Peoples."/>

Did I miss something? I thought it was Sauron, but I guess one could say that Sauron was the greatest enemy of Middle Earth as a whole, whereas Saruman was the largest obstacle to the workings of the Fellowship? Would someone more educated care to set me straight?"/>

&gt; **Forlong the Fat**, the Lord of **Lossarnach**... a man of wide shoulders and huge girth, but old and grey-bearded, yet mail-clad and black-helmed and bearing a long heavy spear. Behind him marched proudly a dusty line of men... men of **Ringló Vale** behind the son of their lord, **Devorin** striding on foot... from the uplands of Morthond, the great **Blackroot Vale**, tall **Duinhir** with his sons, **Duilin** and **Derufin**, and five hundred bowmen. From the Anfalas, the **Langstrand** far away... scantily equipped save for the household of **Golasgil** their Lord... **Hirluin the Fair** of the **Green Hills** from Pennath Gelin... last and proudest, **Imrahil**, **Prince of Dol Amroth**, kinsman of the Lord,...behind them seven hundreds of men at arms, tall as Lords, grey-eyed, dark-haired (Minas Tirith)

The combined hosts were less than three thousand, however."/>
